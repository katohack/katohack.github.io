//about me                           
i like thinking that i know        
what i am doing in hope that        ██ ▄█▀ 
i'll reach that                     ██▄█▒  
                                   ▓███▄░   ██░ ██ 
i like experimenting with my       ▓██ █▄  ▓██░ ██▒
devices, writing simple but        ▒██▒ █▄ ▒██▀▀██░
complex scripts and playing        ▒ ▒▒ ▓▒ ░▓█ ░██ 
metal riffs on guitar.             ░ ░▒ ▒░ ░▓█▒░██▓
                                   ░ ░░ ░   ▒ ░░▒░▒
i wonder which i'll get to master  ░  ░     ▒ ░▒░ ░
first: hacking or playing the               ░  ░░ ░
guitar?                                     ░  ░  ░
